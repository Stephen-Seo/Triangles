# Triangles

THIS PROJECT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!

A gui application that lets you draw triangles of different colors on a colored
background.

Uses [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) for UI.

# Compiling

Create a build dir, run cmake, and then make to build.

    mkdir buildDebug
    cd buildDebug
    cmake ..
    make

## Dependencies

Raylib should be installed on the system. Other third-party dependencies are git
submodules and should be initialized with `git submodule update --init recursive`.
